# Personal-Portfolio-Website---Finalized

A short summary of my website's perpose and theme.
- My website's perpose is to show what I have learned in this class and on my own and putting it to use to create a personal portfolio website. It's also to show off my work from other classes that I have taken.
- My website's theme is responsiveness, efficiency, and branding. I wanted to make a website that is easy to navigate, and that shows who I am.

For color I choose the main colors to be Aqua, Light Grey, and White (For text).
- I choose Aqua because its a refreshing and calming color.
- Light Grey compliments Aqua and gives the webpage sophisticated and modern feel.
- I choose white to use for the text for reading clarity.

For font I choose to use 'Poppins'. It is a san-serif font meaning it is easier to read on screens and fits the clean, modern feeling I was going for with my website. It's also a personal favorite font of mine, if I can get away with using it I will.

For layout I wanted a single page design because it is simpiler to navigate and is faster to load, making for a streamlined user experience. If was also easier to work for me.

Challenges faced when working on this assignemnt.
- I say that one issue I faced was implimented a hamburger menu on my page. I have never tried to impliment one in any of my pervious works, so I had to look up how to do it. It took a bit of time, but I was able to make it work.
- Another issue I came across was implimenting the typewriter animation. I wondered if could do it through javascript instead of css. I don't know much about javascript so I look up if it was even possible. After finding out that I can, learning to impliment it was hard, but after learing how, it was surprisingly easy and improved my understanding of javascript.
